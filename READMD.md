Java Pokemon Battle Simulator

Using Java, I created a Pokemon battle simulator to imitate Pokemon battles that occur in pokemon video games.
The game uses 2 different xml files that the user will have to update in order to create 2 different teams and apply their stats.
Once created the user will be able to simulate a pokemon battle to see which team is stronger.

I had the idea because I had a hand held system while my college roommate played on an emulator and I wanted to battle against him.
Thus, this java application was born.
